# forAlexey

you can view the tests through IDEA
the function itself is in src/main/kotlin/core/Core.kt
tests are located in src/test/kotlin/testCase
you can start the execution of the function with any test (on the green triangle)
in each test, a string is transmitted written in the variable var article ("one two three four five six seven eight nine ten") so as not to run through each test, you can run case 8 (and directly change the transmitted string there)
